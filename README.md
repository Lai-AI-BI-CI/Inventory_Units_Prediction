# Inventory Units Prediction Machine Learning

## Introduction
- Perform inventory forecasting using machine learning techniques to predict future inventory and demand patterns.
- Enable better inventory management, production planning, and resource allocation based on accurate sales forecasts.
- Optimize business strategies and decision-making by understanding market trends and customer behavior.

### Steps for Inventory Forecasting:

1. Data Collection:
   - Gather historical sales data, including time-series information, product attributes, pricing, promotions, and external factors (e.g., holidays, economic indicators).

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
   - Transform and preprocess the data to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyze and visualize the data to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns.
   - Conduct statistical analysis to understand correlations and dependencies between variables.

4. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features from the existing data that can capture important signals and improve forecasting accuracy.
   - Examples include lagged variables, moving averages, time-based features, and categorical encodings.

5. Model Selection:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for demand sales forecasting, such as time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA), regression models, or ensemble methods (e.g., random forests, gradient boosting).

6. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Train the selected model using the training data and validate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, root mean squared error).
   - Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize forecasting accuracy.

7. Forecasting:
   - Apply the trained model to predict future sales and demand patterns.
   - Generate forecasts at desired time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) for the desired forecast horizon.

8. Performance Monitoring and Refinement:
   - Continuously monitor the forecast accuracy and compare it against actual sales data.
   - Refine the forecasting model and retrain it periodically to adapt to changing market conditions and improve accuracy.

9. Decision Making and Actions:
   - Utilize the demand sales forecasts to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, production planning, pricing, promotions, and resource allocation.
   - Optimize business strategies based on forecasted demand patterns and market insights.
